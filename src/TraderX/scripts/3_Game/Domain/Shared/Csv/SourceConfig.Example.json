/*
 * TraderX Source Configuration File
 * 
 * This file controls which configuration format TraderX uses.
 * 
 * PREFERRED FORMAT OPTIONS:
 * ========================
 * 
 * 1. "LEGACY" - Traditional individual JSON files
 *    Location: TraderXConfig/Products/*.json
 *             TraderXConfig/Categories/*.json
 *    Best for: Users who prefer editing individual files per product/category
 *    Migration: Set autoMigrate to true to convert legacy files to CSV
 * 
 * 2. "CSV" - Spreadsheet-friendly CSV files
 *    Location: TraderXConfig/Source/products.csv
 *             TraderXConfig/Source/categories.csv
 *    Best for: Users who prefer editing in Excel/Google Sheets
 *    Note: CSV files are automatically compiled to Compiled JSON on server start
 *    Migration: Set autoMigrate to true to convert legacy files to CSV first
 * 
 * 3. "COMPILED" - Optimized single-file JSON
 *    Location: TraderXConfig/Compiled/Products_compiled.json
 *             TraderXConfig/Compiled/Categories_compiled.json
 *    Best for: Advanced users who want direct control over the runtime format
 *    Note: These files are normally auto-generated from CSV
 *    Migration: Set autoMigrate to true to compile from CSV or legacy
 * 
 * 
 * SETTINGS:
 * =========
 * 
 * preferredFormat (string): Choose "LEGACY", "CSV", or "COMPILED"
 * 
 * autoMigrate (bool): When true, automatically converts from legacy format
 *                     to your preferred format on first run
 *                     - LEGACY mode: No migration happens
 *                     - CSV mode: Converts legacy JSON -> CSV
 *                     - COMPILED mode: Converts legacy -> CSV -> Compiled
 * 
 * allowCompilation (bool): When true (CSV mode), allows CSV -> Compiled conversion
 *                          Set to false to skip compilation and load CSV directly
 *                          (Not applicable for LEGACY or COMPILED modes)
 * 
 * 
 * MIGRATION SCENARIOS:
 * ===================
 * 
 * Converting from Legacy to CSV:
 *   1. Set preferredFormat to "CSV"
 *   2. Set autoMigrate to true
 *   3. Start server - legacy files will be converted to CSV
 *   4. Edit the new CSV files in TraderXConfig/Source/
 *   5. Set autoMigrate to false to prevent re-conversion
 * 
 * Converting from Legacy to Compiled:
 *   1. Set preferredFormat to "COMPILED"
 *   2. Set autoMigrate to true
 *   3. Start server - legacy files will be converted to CSV then Compiled
 *   4. Edit CSV files or directly edit Compiled files
 *   5. Set autoMigrate to false
 * 
 * Sticking with Legacy:
 *   1. Set preferredFormat to "LEGACY"
 *   2. Set autoMigrate to false
 *   3. Continue editing individual JSON files
 * 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * ================
 * 
 * - After migration, your original files are NOT deleted (safety first)
 * - The system logs which format it's using in the server console
 * - If compiled files are corrupt, the system falls back to source files
 * - If source files are missing, the system can auto-migrate from legacy
 * - Always back up your configuration before changing formats!
